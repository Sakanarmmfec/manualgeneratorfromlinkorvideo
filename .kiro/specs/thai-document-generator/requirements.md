## Introduction

This application will automatically generate Thai user manuals and product documents following MFEC's format standards. The system will accept product links as input, use LLM technology to translate, format, organize, and summarize content appropriately, and include relevant images in the final documents. The AI will intelligently restructure and arrange content to create professional, well-organized documentation that follows MFEC's established formatting guidelines.
